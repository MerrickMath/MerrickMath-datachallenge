This challenge is meant to give you a **fun** introduction to exploratory data analysis. 
* First, I would like you to explore https://www.kaggle.com and find a dataset that **interests you**, it can be on any topic from avocado weights to cardiovascular disease.
* Using the dataset you will conduct a brief exploratory data analysis that includes visualization, and analysis of data. I encourage you to pick a numerical variable (like in class) and use a boxplot and histogram to visualize the data. 
* Data anaylsis should be compeleted using a R-Markdown notebook

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ronald Weasley introduces Harry Potter to wizard cards. Every chocolate frog box contains one wizard card. When Harry opens his frog to reveal
an Albus Dumbledore card Ron says "I got about 6 of him". Suppose that the company that makes the frogs suggests that about 12% of boxes contain Albus Dumbledore cards. Run a simulation to figure out how many boxes it takes to get 2 Albus Dumbledore cards.
